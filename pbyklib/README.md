# pbyklib

The `pbyklib` library provides a (nearly) pure Rust implementation of the protocol required to enroll YubiKeys with a
Purebred instance. Purebred is a derived credential issuance system used by the U.S. Department of Defense. This library
is not an official release and is not affiliated with the Defense Information Systems Agency. All testing has been done
using non-production systems.

As with official Purebred apps, enrollment requires the participation of a Purebred Agent. Specifically, when enrolling
the device, you will need a Purebred Agent's EDIPI and a pair of one-time password values generated by that agent and
provided in a timely manner. When provisioning user certificates to the device, user key management (UKM) one-time
passwords (OTPs) are required. These can be obtained by authenticating to the target Purebred instance using the
(simulated) CAC credentials from which dervied credentials will be created.

## Workflow

The workflow consists of four steps, with an optional fifth step that can be used to recover addition escrowed keys.

- [Reset](reset_yubikey::reset_yubikey)
- [Pre-enroll](pre_enroll::pre_enroll)
- [Enroll](enroll::enroll)
- [User key management](ukm::ukm)
- (Optional) [Recover](recover::recover)

## Status

tl;dr: not ready to use.

This is a work-in-progress implementation which is at an early stage of
development.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version
